Uploaded certification and learning achievement files for resume reference!

A little bit about my background here:

If you're reading this, you most likely have my resume in hand. 

#NOTE As a cybersecurity professional, I like to keep my last name redacted on GitHub for, you know,
counter-OSINT purposes.

My undergrad education is not in cyber or anything technical.  What's not listed on there is my love for videogames growing up (and still) and especially computer games.
I learned Networking through Port-forwarding and hosting gaming servers. I learned command-line through enabling the game consoles to run simultaneously so I could cheat
and add gold, health, etc.  I learned coding languages from modding Mincraft and other games through the actual source-code or the config files.  All of this came up
in my initial interviews and is the basis for how I got my internship.  By the start of my intership, it was too late to switch majors to CompSci so I stuck with what I
had.
